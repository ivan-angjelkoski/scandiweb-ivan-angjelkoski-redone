Hello, This is my redone project,where i correct my project with all the feedback received.

1. dangerouslySetInnerHtml is not used. instead a Parser is used.
2. Category ID is added to the path name so users can stay on the same page after reloading.
3. The Green Button on the Product Card Is Implemented, and adds the item to the cart with the default attributes.
4. Category Name is with Capital Letter.
5. The Brand is added to the product card together with the product name.
6. The Backdrop doesn't cover the header.
7. The previous currency is saved in local storage so it stays same after reload.
8. The cart is saved in local storage so it stays same after reload.
9. The Design better matches the provided Figma Design.
10. Attributes are not selectable in cart.
11. Prices are displayed with 2 decimal places.( i would have used the locale javascript method,if there were valid locals provided in gql (ex: 'en-US') )
12. 3 Separate requests for every category page.
